# abstract: We semi-analytically model the effects of primordial black hole (PBH) accretion on the cosmic radiation background during the epoch of reionization (z larger than 6). PBHs in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and haloes, where star formation can occur, are considered. For stars with a mass larger than 25 solar mass, formed in suitable host haloes, we assume they quickly burn out and form stellar remnant black holes (SRBHs). These SRBHs, like PBHs, also accrete material, and are considered to have similar radiation feedback in the halo environment. To improve the background radiation estimation, we consider the impact of PBHs on structure formation, allowing a modified halo mass function. We consider the radiation feedback from a broad suite of black holes: PBHs, SRBHs, high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The result shows that at z greater than 30, the radiation background energy density is generated by PBHs accreting in the IGM, whereas at lower redshifts, halo accretion dominates. We also dissect the total power density by modeling the accretion spectral energy distribution (SED) across different wavebands. In the UV band, we find that for PBH fraction in DM less than 1e-3, the H-ionizing and Lyman Alpha fluxes from PBH accretion feedback do not violate existing constraints on the timing of reionization, and on the effective Wouthuysen-Field coupling of the 21-cm spin temperature of neutral hydrogen to the IGM kinetic temperature. However, in the X-ray band, with the same abundance, PBHs contribute significantly and could explain the unresolved part of the cosmic X-ray background.

We examine the effects of massive primordial black holes (PBHs) on cosmic structure formation, employing both a semi-analytical approach and cosmological simulations. Our simulations incorporate PBHs with a monochromatic mass distribution centered around $10^6 \ \rm M_{\odot}$, constituting a fraction of $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-4}$ of the dark matter (DM) in the universe, with the remainder being collision-less particle dark matter (PDM). Additionally, we conduct a $\Lambda$CDM simulation for comparative analysis with runs that include PBHs. At smaller scales, halos containing PBHs exhibit similar density and velocity dispersion profiles to those without PBHs. Conversely, at larger scales, PBHs can expedite the formation of massive halos and reside at their centers due to the `seed effect'. To analyze the relative distribution of PBH host halos compared to non-PBH halos, we apply nearest-neighbor (NN) statistics. Our results suggest that PBH host halos, through gravitational influence, significantly impact the structure formation process, compared to the $\Lambda$CDM case, by attracting and engulfing nearby newly-formed minihalos. Should PBHs constitute a fraction of DM significantly larger than $\sim$$10^{-3}$, almost all newly-formed halos will be absorbed by PBH-seeded halos. Consequently, our simulations predict a bimodal feature in the halo mass function, with most of the massive halos containing at least one PBH at their core and the rest being less massive non-PBH halos.
