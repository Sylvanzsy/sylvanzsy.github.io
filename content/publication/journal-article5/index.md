# abstract: We semi-analytically model the effects of primordial black hole (PBH) accretion on the cosmic radiation background during the epoch of reionization (z larger than 6). PBHs in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and haloes, where star formation can occur, are considered. For stars with a mass larger than 25 solar mass, formed in suitable host haloes, we assume they quickly burn out and form stellar remnant black holes (SRBHs). These SRBHs, like PBHs, also accrete material, and are considered to have similar radiation feedback in the halo environment. To improve the background radiation estimation, we consider the impact of PBHs on structure formation, allowing a modified halo mass function. We consider the radiation feedback from a broad suite of black holes: PBHs, SRBHs, high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The result shows that at z greater than 30, the radiation background energy density is generated by PBHs accreting in the IGM, whereas at lower redshifts, halo accretion dominates. We also dissect the total power density by modeling the accretion spectral energy distribution (SED) across different wavebands. In the UV band, we find that for PBH fraction in DM less than 1e-3, the H-ionizing and Lyman Alpha fluxes from PBH accretion feedback do not violate existing constraints on the timing of reionization, and on the effective Wouthuysen-Field coupling of the 21-cm spin temperature of neutral hydrogen to the IGM kinetic temperature. However, in the X-ray band, with the same abundance, PBHs contribute significantly and could explain the unresolved part of the cosmic X-ray background.

We investigate the impact of massive primordial black holes (PBHs; $m_{\rm BH}\sim 10^6~M_{\odot}$) on the star formation and first galaxy assembly process using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations from $z = 1100$ to $z \sim 9$. We find that PBH accretion is self-regulated by feedback, suppressing mass growth unless feedback is weak. PBHs accelerate structure formation by seeding dark matter halos and gravitationally attracting gas, but strong feedback can delay cooling and suppress star formation. In addition, the presence of baryonâ€“dark matter streaming creates an offset between the PBH location and the peaks induced in gas density, promoting earlier and more efficient star formation compared to standard $\Lambda$CDM. By $z \sim 10$, PBH-seeded galaxies form dense star clusters, with PBH-to-stellar mass ratios comparable to observed high-$z$ AGN like UHZ-1. Our results support PBHs as viable SMBH seeds but do not exclude alternative scenarios. We emphasize that PBH-seeding provides a natural explanation for some of the newly-discovered overmassive SMBHs at high redshift, in particular those with extreme ratios of BH-to-dynamical (virial) mass that challenge standard formation channels. Future studies with ultra-deep JWST surveys, the Roman Space Telescope, and radio surveys with facilities such as SKA and HERA will be critical in distinguishing PBH-driven SMBH growth from other pathways.
